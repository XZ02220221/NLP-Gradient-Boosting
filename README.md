# NLP-Gradient-Boosting

This is a project that tries to train a machine learning model (XGboost) in order to predict whether an email is spam or not. 
Becuase email text is in string format and contans many typos and punctuations and abbreviations, natural language processing is implemented to clean and vectorize text, before adding the data to model.
